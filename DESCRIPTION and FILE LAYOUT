Our Price prediction tool can be used in by startup company. This tool can be used to provide a better pricing strategy for the products provided by the company for a profitable margin. This project is now scalable around consumer products. Our project has used 5000 sample synthetic data which includes various factors. This model runs on linear regression model with XG-booster to boost its accuracy to 9 points out of 10. The process involves inclusion of incoming pricing factors to which a predicted price and a range of price is given for a suitable profit for the company.
